<h2>About Me</h2>
<ul>

My name is Kyeongan (Karl) Kwon and I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the <a href="http://www.uh.edu" target="_blank">University of Houston</a>. I am also a member of the <a href="http://www.cpl.uh.edu" target="_blank">Computational Physiology Lab</a> under <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=E3oBkwwAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Ioannis Pavlidis</a>.
<br/><br/>
I received my Master of Science in Computer Science from the University of Houston. I used to work for the i2C lab under <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OmPAy2EAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Weidong (Larry) Shi</a> on Mobile HCI and mobile security. I received my Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering from the <a href="http://eng.sejong.ac.kr">Sejong University</a> and working for the <a href="https://us.tmaxsoft.com">TmaxSoft</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialpad">Dial Communications</a> as a software engineer.

<br/><br/>My major area is focusing on information visualization and human-computer interaction (HCI). More specifically, I am interested in exploring how to visualize large scale and complex data effectively. I have created <a href="http://kyeongan.cpl.uh.edu/projects/css/">User Portrait</a>, an online visualization tool to condense large scare data set. I have published several papers to ACM Ubicomp and IEEE VIS, and I have implemented the <a href="http://kyeongan.cpl.uh.edu/projects/css/api/">APIs</a>. I also built <a href="http://www.scholarplot.com">Scholar Plot</a> as a leading developer of our team. It is an online visualization tool to visualize scholarly research accomplishments in an insightful manner.
