<!-- <h2>About Me</h2> -->

<!-- <ul> -->

<!-- My name is Kyeongan (Karl) Kwon and I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the <a href="http://www.uh.edu" target="_blank">University of Houston</a>. I am also a member of the <a href="http://www.cpl.uh.edu" target="_blank">Computational Physiology Lab</a> under <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=E3oBkwwAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Ioannis Pavlidis</a>. -->
<!-- <br/><br/> -->
<!-- I received my Master of Science in Computer Science from the University of Houston. I used to work for the i2C lab under <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OmPAy2EAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Weidong (Larry) Shi</a> on Mobile HCI and mobile security. I received my Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering from the <a href="http://eng.sejong.ac.kr">Sejong University</a> and working for the <a href="https://us.tmaxsoft.com">TmaxSoft</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialpad">Dial Communications</a> as a software engineer. -->

<!-- <br/><br/>My major area is focusing on data visualization. More specifically, I am interested in exploring how to visualize large scale and complex data effectively. I have created <a href="http://kyeongan.cpl.uh.edu/projects/css/">User Portrait</a>, an online visualization tool to condense large scale data set. I have published several papers to ACM Ubicomp and IEEE VIS, and I have implemented the <a href="http://kyeongan.cpl.uh.edu/projects/css/api/">APIs</a>. I also built <a href="http://www.scholarplot.com">Scholar Plot</a> as a leading developer of our team. It is an online visualization tool to visualize scholarly research accomplishments in an insightful manner. -->
<!-- </ul> -->


<!-- <h2>My Recent Projects</h2> -->
<!-- <ul> -->
<!-- I am most comfortable with JavaScript, MySQL, PHP, and other ancillary libraries and frameworks such as jQuery, Twitter Bootstrap, and D3.js. I’ve also used Sublime Text 3 and Eclipse as tools and managed projects with <a href="https://github.com/Kyeongan">GitHub</a>. One such project is <a href="http://www.scholarplot.com">ScholarPlot</a>, a web app which allows users to visualize scholar’s scientific careers at a glance based on data about publications (Journals, Conferences/Books, and Patents) and government funding including NSF, NIH, and NASA. Users can search for a scholar’s name with an ajax call, and the app crawls data from Google Scholar dynamically and fetches funding dataset from the database with the name disambiguation algorithm, and then visualize scholar’s scientific careers at a glance. This app not only visualizes individual accomplishments, but also provides visualization at the group level (Department and college). The visual concept aggregates data which can then be used to provide correlation between impact and resources. -->
<!-- </ul> -->

<!-- <h2>What I’m looking for next</h2> -->

<!-- <ul> -->
<!-- I am looking for the next place that I can make a significant contribution. My favorite thing to do in my spare time is learn. I am a quick learner and I’m able to rapidly get up to speed in a new environment. I have a special place in my heart for data visualization and Web, and would love to work on problems at a large scale. I’m a down-to-earth dude who is passionate about technology, loves a good technical conversation, and I’m anxious to work with others like me. -->

	My name is Kyeongan (Karl) Kwon. I was born in Seoul, Korea, where grew up and studied a bachelor degree in computer science and live in Houston, TX, where study and research thesis and dissertation topics for a PhD degree. A former software engineer at the <a href="http://www.tmaxsoft.com/main.do" target="_blank">TmaxSoft</a>, I have researched and developed enterprise software with the top companies like Samsung, IBM and HP. Now I am a member of the Computational Physiology Lab. (<a href="http://www.cpl.uh.edu" target="_blank">CPL</a>) at the University of Houston since Jan 2013. I have been working under <a href="http://www.cpl.uh.edu/people/ioannis_pavlidis/">Prof. Ioannis Pavlidis</a> on Human-computer Interaction and data visualization. Priory to that, I used to work the i2C Lab under <a href="http://www.larryshi.com" target="_blank">Prof. Larry Weidong Shi</a> working on Mobile HCI and mobile security projects.
